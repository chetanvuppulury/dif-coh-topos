# Working Group on Differential Cohesive Topos

## Outline

The main goal of this seminar is to understand Urs Schreiber’s work [Differential cohomology in a cohesive infinity-topos](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos) and other related material.

## Format

This seminar is inspired [Exodromy](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rdobben/exodromy.html). We aim for informal talks, and we can take as much time as we need. This group can last for a long period so that we can have time to work on more content.

Talks will be on TBA 13:30–15:00 (ET) through Zoom. Everyone who wants to participate can join our Zulip(?) or subscribe our email list.
