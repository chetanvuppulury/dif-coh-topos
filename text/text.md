# Working Group on Differential Cohesive Topos

## Outline

The main goal of this seminar is to understand Urs Schreiber’s work [Differential cohomology in a cohesive infinity-topos](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos) and other related material.

## Format

This seminar is inspired [Exodromy](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rdobben/exodromy.html). We aim for informal talks, and we can take as much time as we need. This group can last for a long period so that we can have time to work on more content.

Talks will be on sometime each week (TBA) through Zoom. Everyone who wants to participate can fill [the form](https://forms.gle/N7Bixe3drvAt7zfS7) (or see [below](#registration)) and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nUkSJJQgee). You can also contact me by [by mail](mailto:keyao.peng@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr).

## About the Prerequisites

Because we can plan for a long time, we can work and discuss some advance and unwell-known prerequisites, like higher topos theory. My point is we do not need to be experts for using them in [DCCIT]. Instead, we can first try to have rough pictures, know what they are, and keep some examples in mind. Then we can use them to read further texts, like here [DCCIT], in that process we can gradually realize those details we missed. That is also the goal of this seminar. We also list some helpful resources below for you.

Of course, there is something we assume is well-known, like basic category theory, differential geometry, algebraic topology... But if you don't have confidence in those, don't worry, since in many cases it just requires to know some concept, and give them new interpretation in high level. On other hand, well-known means there are a lot of materials and not so hard, so you might quickly catch up.
